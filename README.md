# mill
I've created this website for practice. It was made some time ago as a reflection of a sample layout. I've uploaded it here to have an overview on my progress in getting more and more coding/developing skills ;) 

I consider it as one of first stones in my avenue for programming.

**Technologies used: HTML & CSS**
This website is also RWD friendly ;)
